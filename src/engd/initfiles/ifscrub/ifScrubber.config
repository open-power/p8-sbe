# Format:
#   ringXList chipType globalECFilter {
#      ringName.1 [<scope>opt-localECFilter]
#      ...
#      ringName.N [<scope>opt-localECFilter]
#   }
# Where ChipType is one of:
#   - p7
#   - p5ioc2
#   - supernova
#   - torrent
# * The (optional) local ECFilters override the global ECFilter, and consists of:
#   - The word "ANY" -- matches any EC value
#   - A single EC value like used in spydef filenames (eg. "20")
# * Scope is '=' for single or '!' for inverse, where...
#   - Single means exclude this ring for the single EC indicated
#   - Inverse means exclude this ring for all ECs EXCEPT the one indicated
# * ringName.1-ringName.N are (strangely enough) ring names (for N rings)

# Example of global/local ECFilters:
#   ringXList p7 ANY {
#     ri_mary =20      << Exclude only for EC 20
#     rj_jane !10      << Exclude for all EC values except 10
#     rk_smith         << Exclude for any EC value
#   }
